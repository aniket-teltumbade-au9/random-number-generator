# random-number-generator

Navigate to the desired directory in the terminal and execute the following command to run the "randomNumberGenerator.py" Python script:

```cd /path/to/your/directory && python randomNumberGenerator.py```

Replace "/path/to/your/directory" with the actual path to the directory where your "randomNumberGenerator.py" file is located. This command ensures that you change to the specified directory before running the Python script.
